# Concrete strength prediction

## Introduction
This is a ML repository in which you will find a step by step example on how to create your own machine learning model to solve a regression problem and in this particular case how to calculate the concrete's strength. Concrete is the most important material in the profession of a civil engineer. The compressive strength of concrete is a non-linear function of its age and composition. For this reason, calculating the strength of concrete is a demanding and quite difficult process, with a higher percentage of incorrect measurement using conventional methods. The following machine learning model was created to facilitate the calculation of concrete strength. For the perpose of this project, i am using 3 different methods to calculate the concrete's stentgh as accurate as possible.

The 3 methods i used are:
* Linear regression 

* K nearest neighbors

* Random forest

## DATASET
You can find the dataset i am using [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data).
