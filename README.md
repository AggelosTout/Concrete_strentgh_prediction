# Concrete strength prediction

## Introduction
This is a ML repository in which you will find a step by step example on how to create your own machine learning model calculating the strength of concrete. For the perpose of this project i am using 3 different methods to calculate the concrete's stentgh as accurate as i could. The 3 methods i used are:
* Linear regression 

* K nearest neighbors

* Random forest

## DATASET
You can find the dataset i am using [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data).
